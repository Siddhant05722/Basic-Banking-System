--DDL vs DML

Data Definition Language - deals with table structure

Create, Alter, Drop -— DDL commands

Data Manipulation Language — here we deal with the data
directly.

insert, update, delete — DML commands
I
delete from employee; —-DML

Truncate also removes all records — DDL

truncate internally drops the table and recreates it.
